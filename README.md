# Obsidian Issues Buddy Plugin

This plugin creates a table based on your marked questions/issues scattered throughout all files.

## What is Issues Buddy?


When you manage your knowledge base or just take notes, there often arises a need to mark certain information with a question, say you're writing a summary and want to highlight some moments that are not clear to you.

The plugin allows you to find all such questions across all files and display them in one place.


## Usage

To mark questions, special symbols or tags are used. For example:
- the great question of life, the universe and everything ? `#q-life`

In this example, to mark a question, the tag `#q-life` is used where:

`#q-` is the pattern that indicates it's a question
`life` is the topic of the question.
